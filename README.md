#Employee Attrition 

OVERVIEW
This project builds a machine learning model to identify employees at risk of attrition using structured HR data.

APPROACH

Cleaned and encoded structured employee data
Addressed class imbalance using weighted models
Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score (not accuracy alone)

FINDINGS

OVertime is the strongest predictor of attrition
Lower tenure and lower income increase turnover risk
Random Forest provided the best balance of recall and precision

IMPACT

This proactive identification enables targeted retention conversatiuon and reduced replacement costs.

STACK
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
